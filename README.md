# Online_Shopping_Analysis_Using_Machine_Learning_Algorithms
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project aimed at analyzing online shopping behavior to derive actionable insights and predictions. The project involves preprocessing raw data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), applying machine learning algorithms, and evaluating model performance.

# Key Features
  - Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation for model readiness.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes data distributions, correlations, and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - Machine Learning Models: Implements and compares algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests for classification tasks.
  - Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  - Insights: Provides a detailed analysis of customer shopping trends and patterns, enabling better decision-making.

# Technology Stack
  - Programming Language: Python
  - Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
  - Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
